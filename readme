This is a little project I found on youtube:
SQLite3 Tutorial
You can un comment up lines and run the terminal
This line:
conn = sqlite3.connect('_employee.db_')
creates a file on your visual studio code, don't worry about editing it.

just run your files like normal and the __pychache__ folder will populate.
